                <p>Learning coding was very new to me but our teacher taught us from the basics. I started our class with learning about basic tags. There were many new techniques and format. I got to learn about the. I also got to know about GitHub that how can we make repo. I also learnt about pushing a code in github. Github was a completely new topic for me. I got confused. I tried to push my codes in github so many times. I took help of the teacher and online learning platforms but now I am able to upload my code without difficulties.

                    I felt that It was a complex method but I got it in the end. I also learnt how to design forms. The over experience was difficult but I got it. I started to learn how to write basic codes. I also learnt how to used pictures. I learnt about rules too. After learning about the basics we also got to learn about Css and how to link it. We started to design basic site just using colors and 
                    lines.
